👋 Hi, I’m Julia
👀 I’m interested in climbing, playing the drums, cooking and board games.
🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript / React.
💞️ I would like to collaborate on a nerdy music database app.

I studied chemistry and after graduating I worked in clinical research for several years. As my job involved extensive travel, I quit my job with the hope of discovering a new direction. During the summer of 2023, I taught myself the basics of Python. Enjoying the coding experience, I decided to transition to a career as a developer and learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React on my own. I enrolled in a web development course at Le Wagon, where they teach Ruby on Rails.

In school, I had IT lessons where we coded strategic games using Turbo Pascal. During university, I took a number theory course where we used Maple to implement algorithms. Thus, coding is not entirely new to me.

If you are curious how I came up with my github nickname, it is from one of my favourite TV series, "My name is Earl".
